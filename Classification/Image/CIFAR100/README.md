# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a classification model using audio data in [NeoPulse® AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

# Data
The data for this task can be found at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
To run this example, first you will need to download and pre-process the raw data for the CIFAR-100 task using the included ```build_csv.py``` script:

```bash
$ python build_csv.py
```

If the script fails, make sure that you have installed all the package dependencies of this script which are: `gzip, shutil, pathlib, numpy, requests, imageio, and python-CIFAR100`.

Missing packages can be installed using pip:
```bash
$ pip install <package_name>
```

Once you've downloaded and pre-processed the data, you can start training using any of the NML scripts provided. To begin training:
```bash
$ neopulse train -p <project_name> -f /absolute/path/to/CIFAR100_full_auto.nml
```
In NML file, relative path of .csv file is declared in the line:
```bash
bind = "training_data.csv" ;
```

# Tutorial Files
**build_csv.py:** Script creates list of training files and writes training full image paths and corresponding labels to a training CSV file.

**cifar100_full_auto.nml:** Features full use of the auto keyword to automatically generate the entire architecture.

**cifar100_call_auto.nml:** Features the use of auto to automatically select an architecture later.

**cifar100_choice_auto.nml:** Features use of auto keyword to automatically select from range of values for a given parameter.

**cifar100_dist_auto.nml:** Features use of the auto keyword to automatically select a value from a specified distribution of values (e.g. gaussian).
