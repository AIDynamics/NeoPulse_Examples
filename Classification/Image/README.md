# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a classification model using image data in [NeoPulse® AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

# Data
Data for these examples are from the [CIFAR 10 and 100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) datasets.

The CIFAR-10 dataset features 60,000 32x32 color images among 10 classes (6,000 images per class). CIFAR-100 version features 100 classes (600 images per class). 50,000 images are for training and 10,000 are reserved for testing.

The MNIST dataset features 60,000 handwritten digits with 10,000 reserved for test. More information on the datasets and data formats can be found at the links above.

The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. Because Permission is needed to download ImageNet Dataset, users needs to download and build .csv file themselves. After that, users could use NML file in ImageNet folder to train the model in AI Studio.
