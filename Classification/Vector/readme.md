# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a classification model using flat vector data in [NeoPulse™ AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

**Please Note**: This sample .nml code generates a simple model which is not designed to achieve high accuracy. Using high quality, custom data will help achieve higher accuracy. 

# Data
Data for this example is from the [Blood Transfusion Service Center](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center). The dataset features 748 instances across 5 attributes.
