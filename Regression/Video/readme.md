# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a regression model using video data in [NeoPulse™ AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

Please Note: This sample .nml code generates a simple model which is not designed to achieve high accuracy. Using high quality, custom data will help achieve higher accuracy.

# Data
Data for this example is from the [Human Actions Dataset] (http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/). The dataset features 25 subjects, 6 actions, and 4 scenarios.

# Tutorial Videos and Guides
