# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a regression model using flat vector data in [NeoPulse™ AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

**Please Note**: This sample .nml code generates a simple model which is not designed to achieve high accuracy. Using high quality, custom data will help achieve higher accuracy. 

# Data
Data for this example is from the [Auto MPG Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg). The dataset features 389 instances across 8 attributes on auto information. Data files are in .data format. If you are unfamiliar with this file type, simply click on the filename and manually copy and paste data into a text editor of your choice.
