# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a regression model using text data in [NeoPulse™ AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

**Please Note**: This sample .nml code generates a simple model which is not designed to achieve high accuracy. Using high quality, custom data will help achieve higher accuracy. 

# Data
Data for this example is from the [Portland Housing Dataset](https://github.com/girishkuniyal/Predict-housing-prices-in-Portland). The dataset features 48 instances from 3 attributes.
