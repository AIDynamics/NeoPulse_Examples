# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a PCA model using image data in [NeoPulse® AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

# Data
The data for this task can be found at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
To run this example, first you will need to download and pre-process the raw data for the MNIST task using the included ```build_csv.py``` script:

```bash
$ python build_csv.py
```

If the script fails, make sure that you have installed all the package dependencies of this script which are: `gzip, os, shutil, pathlib, numpy, requests, imageio, and python-mnist`.

Missing packages can be installed using pip:
```bash
$ pip install <package_name>
```

Once you've downloaded and pre-processed the data, you can start training using any of the NML scripts provided. To begin training:
```bash
$ neopulse train -p <project_name> -f /absolute/path/to/pca.nml
```
In NML file, relative path of .csv file is declared in the line:
```bash
bind = "training_data.csv" ;
```

# Tutorial Files
**build_csv.py:** Script creates list of training files and writes training full image paths and corresponding labels to a training CSV file.
**pca.nml:** NML file defines a pca process where the model is trained with all the data in one time.
**pca_batch.nml:** NML file defines a pca process where the model is trained with batched data.
