Risk Allocation and Pricing. End user understands and accepts that the provisions in this agreement (including any warranty disclaimers and limitations on liability) represent an agreed upon price-risk allocation between DM and end user.

Purpose and Coverage of License.
This license covers one or more of software code, software packages, software modules, documentation, training data, data, or other forms of information (the “End User Accessible Materials”) provided to end User by DM via GitHub. The purpose of the End User Accessible Materials is to provide developers using Dimensional Mechanics Inc.’s NeoPulse AI Framework (the “Framework”) with end to end, fully documented examples of the use and capabilities of the Framework. Typically, these examples include all the relevant NML files (DM’s domain specific language for use in operating the elements of the Framework), parsers, and scripts to download training data, format that data, construct CSV’s, and define training to build an AI model. Software code may be provided will help users understand how to write NML files for performing training on data sets of common types (including images and text). Examples may include working NML files for popular open source data sets such as CIFAR-10 for image classification. 

The intent of providing these examples is to help developers learn how to use the NeoPulse AI Framework by showing them examples that they can run on the provided datasets and then modify to more quickly train new AI models on their own internal data sets. Ideally, these examples will expedite the time it takes a software engineer using the NeoPulse AI Framework to become sufficiently familiar with NML to more rapidly start training state of the art AI models.

Licensed Activities. Upon satisfaction of any registration by the End User or other requirements put in place by DM, End User may access, download, and utilize the End User Accessible Materials (“materials”) for one or more of the following purposes:
•	Sharing with other users of the Framework;
•	Modify the materials as follows
o	Modify NML files to facilitate training of End User’s own AI model(s)
o	Modify parsing and formatting files to create the CSV files for End User’s internal data
•	Deploy the modified materials
o	Query example models with AI Studio or the Query Runtime

Activities that are not licensed. Note that it is not the intent or purpose of providing the End User Accessible Materials (“materials”) to enable the End User to perform any one or more of the following:
•	reproduce, recreate, or otherwise replace the DM Framework;
•	reverse engineer the DM complier;
•	use the materials in pursuit of any illegal or inappropriate activity;
•	use the materials in any way that brings or would be expected to bring disrepute to DM;
•	charge another person or entity for use of the materials.

License Revocation. Any activities which DM becomes aware of that are believed by DM to be intended for one or more of the unintended purposes will result in immediate revocation of this license, and may lead to a further action by DM to protect its rights.
