# Introduction
These sample .nml files are for training a Capsule Network classification model using audio data in [NeoPulse® AI Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B074NDG36S/ref=vdr_rf).

# Data
Data for this example is from the [Music Genres Dataset](http://opihi.cs.uvic.ca/sound/genres.tar.gz). The dataset features 100 audio samples from 10 music genres.
To run this example, first you will need to download and pre-process the raw data for the music classification task using the included ```build_csv.py``` script:

```bash
$ python build_csv.py
```

If the script failes, make sure that you have installed all the package dependencies of this script which are listed at the top of the script:
`tarfile, shutil, pathlib, requests, natsort, and random`. Missing packages can be installed using pip:

```bash
$ pip install <package_name>
```

Once you've downloaded and pre-processed the data, you can start training using any of the NML scripts provided. To begin training:
```bash
$ neopulse train -p <project_name> -f /absolute/path/to/music_capsule.nml
```
In NML file, relative path of .csv file is declared in the line:
```bash
bind = "training_data.csv" ;
```

<b>NOTE: Audio files are big! Be careful with your batch size, or you may get out of memory (OOM) errors. If that happens, reduce the batch size.</b>
