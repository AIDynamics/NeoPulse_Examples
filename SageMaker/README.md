# NeoPulse® on AWS SageMaker

We have included a sample Jupyter Notebook as an example of how to use the Python API for AWS SageMaker to launch NeoPulse® training and inference jobs.

To use this notebook, you will need a Python 3 environment with jupyter. To install jupyter:

```
$ pip3 install jupyter
```

To launch the notebook, from this directory in a terminal window:

```

```

Then follow the directions in the terminal.
